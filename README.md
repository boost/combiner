# Boost browser extension

The missing link between Harvest - PivotalTracker - Basecamp track your time
directly from the PivotalTracker interface and generate acceptance messages from your stories.

We use Harvest, we use PivotalTracker, we use Basecamp. We thought it would be cool to link up
our Harvest timesheets directly to our PivotalTracker stories to simplify
tracking and review, and also generate ready for acceptance messages for basecamp from pivotal.
