# Boost browser extension

The missing link between Harvest - PivotalTracker - Basecamp. Track your time
directly from the PivotalTracker interface and generate acceptance messages from your stories.

We use Harvest, we use PivotalTracker, we use Basecamp. We thought it would be cool to link
our Harvest timesheets directly to our PivotalTracker stories to simplify
tracking and review, and also generate ready for acceptance messages for basecamp from pivotal.

**Google Chrome and Firefox are currently the only supported browsers.**
